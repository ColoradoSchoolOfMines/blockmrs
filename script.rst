It all starts on the field. Whether it's soccer, football, or basketball: the
one thing you can be sure of is that eventually a player will end up hurt.

A high school basketball team has made it to the playoffs. The game is close and
the time on the clock is running low. Jimmy, the coach's son gets hold on the
ball and makes a break for the other side of the court. As he closes in for a
shot, he is knocked to the floor, face first. His teammates encourage him to
stay in the game but his father, the coach in unsure, and there is nobody on
site who is able to immediatly make a diagnosis. The coach pulls out his smart
phone and opens his heathcare providor's BlockMRS application. Using the app he
is able to quickly enter symptoms his son is exhibiting and the app recommends
for him to call an ambulance. The symptoms are the easily shared with the
hospital so that his son can get the care that he needs.

Unlike professional leagues, high school sports suffer from a defecit of doctors
on the field and ready in the event of injury. BlockMRS, our solution to help
people like Jimmy, improves medical outcomes through an innovative recording,
storage, and sharing system backed by today's latest technologies.

For the individual, BlockMRS provides a well needed upgrade to our medical
records system with regards to privacy and control over one's data. From only
sharing the information needed and that your are comfortable with, BlockMRS
enables the user to retake control of their data. BlockMRS improves the medical
experience for the comsumers, with less forms to fill out, improved outcomes,
and more time spent focusing on your health.

Our *InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)* based storage backend makes use of the
latest technology to create a secure, private, and decetralized system to
storing and sharing medical data. Each update to a user's medical history is
encrypted with a new randomly generated public key and upload to the IPFS
network. Then, through our blockchain-based key sharing system, the user can
delegate exactly who should have acces to this data, whether it's their general
practicioner, the hospital, or a loved one.
